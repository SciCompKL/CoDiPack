   * @brief Mutex construct that distinguishes between lock for read and lock for write.

   * Since not all shared memory parallel APIs provide such mutexes, this is a custom implementation based on the atomic
   * type.
   *
   * The custom locking mechanism is annotated for the thread sanitizer so that the synchronization due to this mutex
   * is captured correctly when checking for data races.
   *
   * The user is responsible for correct pairing of lockForRead, unlockForRead and lockForWrite, unlockForWrite,
   * respectively. Use of the RAII locks LockForRead and LockForWrite is advised.
   *
   * Recursive locking for read is supported.
