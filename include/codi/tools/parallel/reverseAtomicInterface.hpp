  /**
   * @brief Provides a data type on which += update operations are performed atomically.
   *
   * In a multithreaded environment, data races on adjoint variables are fixed by performing updates atomically, whereas
   * other read and write operations do not need to be atomic. This template takes an ordinary adjoint variable type,
   * like a floating point type or a CoDiPack forward type, and ensures that the corresponding += update operation is
   * performed atomically.
   *
   * Implementations likely require template specializations with respect to the underlying type, especially if it is an
   * active CoDiPack type.
   *
   * An implementation should preserve the memory footprint of the underlying type, e.g., by inheriting from the under-
   * lying type or by having a variable of the underlying type as the only member variable.
   *
   * @tparam T_Type  The underlying data type.
   * @tparam T_Impl  Implementing class.
