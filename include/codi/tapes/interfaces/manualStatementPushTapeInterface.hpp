   * @brief Add derivative information for custom operations to the tape.
   *
   * See \ref TapeInterfaces for a general overview of the tape interface design in CoDiPack.
   *
   * The functions in this interface can be used to provide derivative information to CoDiPack for functions that are
   * not known to CoDiPack but so small that an external function implementation is an overkill.
   *
   * The \ref sec_forwardAD "forward" and \ref sec_reverseAD "reverse" AD equations are the base for this interface. The
   * user has to provide the Jacobian \f$ \frac{\d \phi}{\d u} \f$ for all arguments \f$u\f$ and compute the value for
   * \f$w\f$.
   *
   * Before the call to storeManual the user has to update the value of the output, that is, \f$w\f$ in the above
   * equations. This is usually done with `output.value() = w`. Afterwards, storeManual() has to be called. The `size`
   * argument is the number of arguments \f$u\f$ from the equations above. This call ensures that `output` gets a
   * proper identifier and the dependency chain is not broken or wrong for this variable.
   *
   * Afterwards the user has to call pushJacobiManual() for each argument \f$u\f$.
   *
   * The user has to ensure that the computations of the Jacobians are evaluated such that the CoDiPack tape does not
   * accidentally record them.
   *
   * Here is an example for manual statement push (documentation/examples/manualStatementPushTapeInterface.cpp):
   * \snippet examples/manualStatementPushTapeInterface.cpp Manual statement push
   *
   * @tparam T_Real        The computation type of a tape, usually chosen as ActiveType::Real.
   * @tparam T_Gradient    The gradient type of a tape, usually chosen as ActiveType::Gradient.
   * @tparam T_Identifier  The adjoint/tangent identification type of a tape, usually chosen as ActiveType::Identifier.
