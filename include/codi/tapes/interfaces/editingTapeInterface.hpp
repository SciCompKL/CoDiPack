  /**
   * @brief Edit tapes after they have been recorded.
   *
   * These interface functions can be used to modify the tape after it has been recorded. Specifically, they allow to
   * erase parts of a tape, and to append a specific range of a source tape to a destination tape.
   *
   * This interface was introduced for additional flexibility when managing multiple tapes in a shared-memory parallel
   * context. The erase function, for example, can be used to remove a preliminary recording from the tape once
   * additional information is available. The append function can be used to move recordings ending up in the wrong tape
   * to the correct one. This is only required in edge cases and most AD workflows will never make use of this
   * interface, especially if they use only a single tape. Other cases might be covered by (positional) tape resets.
   *
   * Note that tapes with a linear index management strategy (see LinearIndexManager) can't implement this interface
   * because a statement's left hand side index is implicitly encoded in the statement's position on the tape. Erasing
   * parts of a tape would produce wrong subsequent left hand side indices, and appending statements from one tape to
   * another is not meaningful because the sequences of left hand side indices are tape-specific.
   *
   * @tparam T_Position  Global tape position, usually chosen as Tape::Position.
