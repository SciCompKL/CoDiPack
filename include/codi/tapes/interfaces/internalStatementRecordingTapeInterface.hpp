  /**
   * @brief Internal tape interface that is used by active types to trigger the storing of an expression.
   *
   * See \ref TapeInterfaces for a general overview of the tape interface design in CoDiPack.
   *
   * This interface contains callbacks used by AD variables to access the tape implementation. Each AD variable in the
   * program allocates an identifier and this identifier has to be initialized with a call to initIdentifier(). When an
   * AD variable in the program is destroyed, its identifier has to be freed by the tape by a call to
   * destroyIdentifier() before it is deallocated.
   *
   * The compile time switch AllowJacobianOptimization signals the AD variables that the underlying tape is a Jacobian
   * tape, indicating that certain operations can be hidden from the tape recording process.
   *
   * store() has to be called by the AD variable every time it is assigned. The left hand side value (lhs) has to
   * implement LhsExpressionInterface, the right hand side value (rhs) has to implement ExpressionInterface.
   *
   * ActiveType is the default implementation in CoDiPack which uses this interface and implements the behavior
   * described above.
   *
   * @tparam T_Identifier  The adjoint/tangent identification type of a tape, usually chosen as ActiveType::Identifier.
