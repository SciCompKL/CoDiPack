  /**
   * @brief Add user defined functions to the tape evaluation.
   *
   * See \ref TapeInterfaces for a general overview of the tape interface design in CoDiPack.
   *
   * External functions allow the user to evaluate custom operations during a tape evaluation. Each external function
   * has pointers for the reverse, forward and primal evaluation of a tape. A function pointer may be null if the
   * corresponding mode is not called on the tape. Otherwise, if the corresponding pointer is null and the
   * corresponding mode is called on the tape, then a CODI_EXCEPTION is thrown.
   *
   * What kind of operations are evaluated in the external function is up to the user. They are usually used to define
   * derivative computations for libraries that cannot be differentiated with operator overloading.
   *
   * Variables that are outputs of external functions have to be registered with registerExternalFunctionOutput. This
   * will ensure that the variable is considered as active in CoDiPack. For primal value tapes, the return value of this
   * function provides the old value stored under the identifier that the variable has received. This old value has to
   * be restored with a call to adjointInterface.setPrimal() during the evaluation of the external function in reverse
   * mode.
   *
   * Here is an example (documentation/examples/externalFunctionTapeInterface.cpp):
   * \snippet examples/externalFunctionTapeInterface.cpp External function
   *
   * @tparam T_Real        The computation type of a tape, usually chosen as ActiveType::Real.
   * @tparam T_Gradient    The gradient type of a tape, usually chosen as ActiveType::Gradient.
   * @tparam T_Identifier  The adjoint/tangent identification type of a tape, usually chosen as ActiveType::Identifier.
