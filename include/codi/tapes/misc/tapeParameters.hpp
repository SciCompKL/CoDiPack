   * @brief Policies for management of the tape's interal adjoints.
   *
   * For the convenience of the user, tapes manage their internal adjoints automatically, which involves multiple
   * tasks. AdjointsManagement::Manual indicates that non of these tasks is performed - they are the responsibility of
   * the caller instead. Functions that take an AdjointsManagement parameter default to AdjointsManagement::Automatic
   * and document the individual effects of AdjointsManagement::Manual. An overview over all possible effects is given
   * below.
   *
   * <b>Bounds checking.</b> The function accesses the adjoints. In the automatic mode, it checks whether the
   * adjoints are sufficiently large. If they are not, they might be <b>resized</b> or the
   * function might work on or return <b>dummy values</b>. To optimize the memory usage and/or reduce the number of
   * reallocations, AdjointsManagement::Manual can be used to skip bounds checking and resizing. It is the
   * responsibility of the caller to ensure sufficient adjoints size, for example by calls to
   * DataManagementTapeInterface::resizeAdjointVector.
   *
   * <b>Declaration of adjoints usage (locking).</b> If a tape implements it adjoints against
   * InternalAdjointsInterface, it keeps track of whether the adjoint vector is in use, which is for example the case
   * during tape evaluations. This is to ensure mutual exclusion with reallocations, this is particularly important in
   * shared-memory parallel taping, see also ThreadSafeGlobalAdjoints. Declaration of usage involves setting a lock,
   * which can become a bottleneck if it is done frequently. To optimize the performance, multiple operations can be
   * grouped into a single usage declaration, by surrounding them by manual
   * DataManagementTapeInterface::beginUseAdjoints and DataManagementTapeInterface::endUseAdjoints calls and invoking
   * them with AdjointsManagement::Manual. Note that any method that results in adjoint vector resizing must be called
   * outside usage declarations, otherwise there would be a deadlock.
