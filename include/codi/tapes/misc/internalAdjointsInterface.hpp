  /**
   * @brief Abstracts the internal set of adjoint variables provided as part of the tape.
   *
   * This interface describes the interaction between a tape and its associated adjoint variables as well as the state
   * of the adjoint variables. Details on how the adjoint variables are implemented are abstracted away by this
   * interface.
   *
   * The adjoint variables can be read and written, resized, zeroed, and swapped. The number of adjoint variables can be
   * queried, and, if applicable, a raw pointer to an underlying array implementation can be obtained.
   *
   * The set of adjoint variables can be "in use" or "not in use". The adjoint variables are "in use" whenever there is
   * read or write access to adjoint variables, or when any general property of the set of adjoint variables such as
   * size is queried. The implementations of this interface ensure mutual exclusion between the "in use" state and
   * reallocations of the set of adjoint variables due to resizing. Resizing is only allowed if the adjoint variables
   * are "not in use". The implementations of data() and size() are expected to declare usage
   * internally, if needed. For performance reasons, the operator[]() accessors and zeroAll() don't declare usage
   * internally. Instead, the tape is responsible for this. It should declare usage by calls to beginUse() and endUse().
   * This way, multiple such calls can be safeguarded by a single usage declaration.
   *
   * The tape must not call resize() as long as it has declared usage.
   *
   * To give an example, tape evaluation involves multiple operator[]() calls. Prior to the evaluation, the tape ensures
   * that the set of adjoint variables is sufficiently large. It calls beginUse() before the evaluation and endUse()
   * after it. During the evaluation, no further resizing  of the set of adjoint variables takes place.
   *
   * See codi::DataManagementTapeInterface for a multithreading perspective on the "in use" mechanism.
   *
   * A tape that maintains its adjoints internally against this interface can easily exchange the adjoint
   * implementation. The principle use case of this interface is, at the moment, replacing a classical, tape-local
   * adjoint vector by a thread-safe global one for use in a shared-memory parallel setting, see LocalAdjoints and
   * ThreadSafeGlobalAdjoints.
   *
   * @tparam T_Gradient    The gradient type of a tape, usually chosen as ActiveType::Gradient.
   * @tparam T_Identifier  The adjoint/tangent identification of a tape, usually chosen as ActiveType::Identifier.
   * @tparam T_Tape        The associated tape type.
