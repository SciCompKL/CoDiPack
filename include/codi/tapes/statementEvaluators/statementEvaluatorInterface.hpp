   * @brief Creation of handles for the evaluation of expressions in a context where the expression type is not
   * available.
   *
   * For primal value taping, the expression templates create a problem. The expression type and value is generated in
   * the code where the statement is evaluated. The type and value of the expression is required again to evaluate
   * the reverse or forward mode of the elemental function described by the expression (see
   * \ref AD_TheoryMathematicalDefinitions). The problem is that types cannot be stored in C++. Also, the value of the
   * expression is context specific and this context is not available during the tape interpretation either. The
   * generation of handles solves this problem by providing the tape with functions for the evaluation of the
   * expressions. Since these functions can be instantiated with the type of the expression, inside of the handles, the
   * expression type is available again. For more details on the topic please see \ref SAG2018Expression.
   *
   * The creation of the handles is tightly coupled with the implementing tape. The tape defines how the data for the
   * expression is loaded and which functions are evaluated on the expression in order to perform the necessary
   * operations for the tape. However, how the handles are generated, how the data for the handles is stored (e.g. which
   * kinds of function pointers) and how they are evaluated is neither tape specific nor is one way optimal for every
   * use case.
   *
   * The process of evaluating a handle can be separated into multiple steps:
   * - 1. Load statement specific data
   * - 2. Load expression specific data
   * - 3. Call expression specific function
   *
   * The call to a handle may take place either between step 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. The advantage between step 1 and 2 is
   * that it is very simple to implement, the disadvantage is that the expression specific data load is handled after
   * the function pointer call. The compiler can therefore not optimize these data loading calls. If the call of the
   * handle is between step 2 and 3, then the compiler can optimize the generalized data handling and only the specifics
   * for the expression are hidden behind the function pointer call. However, in order to perform step 2, the tape needs
   * some expression specific data which has to be extracted from the handle. Therefore, the implementation is more
   * involved.
   *
   * The first approach (handle call between step 1 and 2) is defined by the StatementEvaluatorTapeInterface.
   * The second approach (handle call between step 2 and 3) is defined by the StatementEvaluatorInnerTapeInterface.
   *
   * In general, the tape implements the interfaces mentioned above. However, special cases like preaccumulation support
   * requires a different generator. Therefore, `createHandle` has two template arguments, one for the tape and one for
   * the generator.
   *
   * In general, implementations of this interface need to store functions pointers to the `statementEvaluate*`
   * functions of the StatementEvaluatorTapeInterface or function pointers to the `statementEvaluate*Inner` of the
   * StatementEvaluatorInnerTapeInterface.
   *
   * A usual call flow for the first approach is (see also the code for ReverseStatementEvaluator):
   * \code{.cpp}
   *   // During recording in tape.store.
   *   // Instantiates e.g Tape::statementEvaluateReverse<Expr>
   *   auto handle = StatementEvaluatorInterface::createHandle<Tape, Tape, Expr>();
   *   tapeData.pushHandle(handle);
   *
   *   // During reverse interpretation of the tape.
   *   auto handle = tapeData.popHandle(handle);
   *
   *   // This calls Tape::statementEvaluateReverse<Expr>(tapeData);
   *   StatementEvaluatorInterface::callReverse(handle, tapeData);
   * \endcode
   *
   * @tparam T_Real  The computation type of a tape, usually chosen as ActiveType::Real.
