   *                               gradient.
   * @tparam   GradientValueType The value type that is used for the gradient calculation.
   * @tparam TapeImplementation  The implementing tape of the interface. It is needed to define the active type
   *                               for the registration of the variables.
   * @tparam           Position  Position used by the implementing tape.
