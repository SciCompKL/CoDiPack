 * This file defines function overloads of the kind:
 *
 * The (complex, complex) case is not defined, since it is handled by the real definitions.
 * bool operator OPERATOR(ExpressionInterface<std::complex<Real>, ArgA> const&, PassiveReal const&);
 * bool operator OPERATOR(PassiveReal const&,                                   ExpressionInterface<std::complex<Real>, ArgB> const&)
 *
 * In order to include this file the user has to define the preprocessor macros OPERATION_LOGIC and FUNCTION.
 * OPERATION_LOGIC contains the name of the operation logic class. FUNCTION represents the normal name of that function
 * e.g. 'operator -' or 'sin'.
 *
 * The defines OPERATION_LOGIC and FUNCTION will be undefined at the end of this template.
 *
 * Prior to including this file, the user has to implement the operation's primal and derivative logic according to
 * BinaryOpInterface.
