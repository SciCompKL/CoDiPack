   * The algorithm behind the selection walks along the value path of the derivatives. A higher order
   * derivative, that is combined via the CoDiPack types, has \f$2^n\f$ possible derivative values
   * (including the primal value) with \f$n\f$ the number of nested types. If a second and third order type is

   * \code{.cpp}
   *  typedef RealForwardGen<RealForward> t2s;
   *  typedef RealForwardGen<t2s>         t3s;
   * \endcode
   * then the second order type t2s has 4 possible values \f$(n = 2)\f$ and the third order type has 8
   * possible values \f$(n = 3)\f$. The number of derivatives per derivative order can be computed via
   * the binomial coefficient \f$(n over k)\f$ where \f$k\f$ is the derivative order. For a second order type
   * this yields 1 derivative of zero order (the primal value) two derivatives of the first order and one
   * derivative of the second order. For a third order type this is 0:1, 1:3, 2:3, 3:1.
   *
   * The algorithm in the class will now select the appropriate derivative. The user provides the values
   * k and the number of the derivative he wants to select i.e. \f$0, ... (n over k) - 1\f$.
   *
   * The algorithm walks the graph of the CoDiPack types and selects if the primal value or the derivative
   * value should be selected. For the third order type the graph looks like:
   *
   *  t3s  t2s  t1s  double | order  index
   *                        |
   *               ,---o    |  3     0
   *              /         |
   *            ,o-----o    |  2     2
   *           /            |
   *          /    ,---o    |  2     1
   *         /    /         |
   *        o----o-----o    |  1     2
   *       /                |
   *      /        ,---o    |  2     0
   *     /        /         |
   *    /       ,o-----o    |  1     1
   *   /       /            |
   *   |      /    ,---o    |  1     0
   *   |     /    /         |
   *   o----o----o-----o    |  0     0
   *
   * The lower branch always stand for the primal value and the upper branch always stands for the derivative
   * value.
   * The two columns at the end show the derivative order under the column 'order' and the index in that order
   * class under the column 'index'. It can be seen that the different derivative values of the same order are
   * not continuously ordered in the graph.
   *
   * The class provides  methods for the runtime selection of the derivatives. If theses methods are
   * used, then the AD types need to be defined such that all primal and derivative values have the same type.
   * If this is not the case, then the compiler will show errors, that it can not convert a value.
   *
   * The class provides methods for the compile time selection of the derivatives, too. These methods do not have
   * the restriction, that all the primal and derivative types need to have the same type. On the other hand
   * all compile time restrictions apply to the parameters of the templates. That is, they need to be compile
   * time constants.
   * Also the setDerivatives method which sets all derivatives of one order may not be used if different primal
   * and gradient types are used. The provided objects needs to be convertible into all possible types, that
   * are used at the termination points of the recursion.
