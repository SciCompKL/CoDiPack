Tutorials & Examples {#TutorialsAndExamples}
=======

Tutorials provide a detailed explanation of the most common CoDiPack features. They try to explain nearly everything so
that also beginners should have no problem to apply AD to a code.

Examples provide in most cases only the code for using the necessary features. Some examples have some helpful remarks
or pointers to other features.

The graph shows how the tutorials and examples are connected. Usually it is better to understand first the prerequisites
of a tutorial/example before reading the actual example.
